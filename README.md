To do next time:

make jupyter notebook 

-other controllers? (non - linear)

-walls in csv?? (assembling)

-adding Qa of random people etc that are heating the room // adding advection



Question: why does the temperature not start at 0 for the second room?

Question: why is everything so slow, right now I just imposed a half an hour time step but otherwise the resampling is slower than an hour. 

Question: Why do you use the total area for the phi (radiance) because the floor is not radiated?
